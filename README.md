## How It Works

This project is a **Node.js-based Instagram video downloader API**.  
It fetches public Instagram Reels or video posts, extracts the direct video stream, and returns it via a simple HTTP endpoint.

The server acts as a lightweight proxy between the client and Instagram’s media servers.
